Icebreakers are a great way for a team to get to know each other better. Let's get to know each other!

## Adding an entry

To add entry, edit the ```people.txt``` file by adding your information either at the very top or very bottom of the file. 

*Note:* The format for each entry is as follows:
```
Name: <your full name> 
EG: <your expected graduation year>
Favorite Food: <your favorite food>
```
Example: 
```
Name: John Doe
EG: 2025
Favorite Food: Spinach
```

If you're adding at the top, make sure there is a space **after** your entry:
```
{Your Entry}
[space]
{Others' entries}
```


If you're adding at the bottom, make sure there is a space **before** your entry:
```
{Others' entries}
[space]
{Your Entry}
```


Please keep this in mind when making changes.
